Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - daemon
 Usdecoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that
 is completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or
 trusted parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and
 transact directly with each other, with the help of a P2P network to
 check for double-spending.
 .
 This package provides the daemon, usdecoind, and the CLI tool
 usdecoin-cli to interact with the daemon.

Description: peer-to-peer digital currency - standalone transaction tool
 Usdecoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that
 is completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or
 trusted parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and
 transact directly with each other, with the help of a P2P network to
 check for double-spending.
 .
 This package provides usdecoin-tx, a command-line transaction creation
 tool which can be used without a usdecoin daemon.  Some means of
 exchanging minimal transaction data with peers is still required.
